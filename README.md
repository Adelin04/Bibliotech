# Bibliotech
Bibliotech app

    "Bibliotech" is the backend of a book renting app and it was created in Python Flask. 
This was a required task in module three of the courses I took at the 'Academia te fac programator'. 
It uses 4 .txt files to store the data:(DB_books,DB_reviews,DB_transactions,DB_users).
 In addition to the taskâ€™s requirements            
I created an algorithm that reads the text files and increment the number of the next item 
that will be added in the file to mimic the auto increment of a real database
